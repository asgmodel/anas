        # Research Projects

        I have been involved with many research projects over the years. I'm currently looking into two main topics:
        - Security of Smart Infrastructure, which includes with my involvement in the PETRAS Centre, within which I'm
        leading two projects directly related to the security and privacy of smart buildings. My main collaborators
        include
        Lilian Edwards (Law School), Luke Smith (Engineering), John Mace (Computing) and Rima Alaeedine (Computing).
        I've also done some with Carsten Maple (Warwick) within PETRAS on risk assessment for smart buildings.
        As part of this topic, I'm also involved in a Security work-package in the Active Building Centre,
        working with Sara Walker (Engineering) and Ricardo Czekster (Computing), as well as John Clark (Sheffield) and
        Walter Bassage (Sheffield). Finally, I'm leading a Security work-package in the e4Future project,
        working with Myriam Neaimeh (Engineering) and Roberto Metere (Computing) on vehicle-to-grid systems.

        - Access Control, which was my PhD topic and on which I have had many collaborations over the years, including
        notably Nicola Zannone (TU Eindhoven) and Jason Crampton (Royal Holloway). Our initial paper on PTaCL has
        established a formal semantics for attribute-based access control (ABAC and introduced the problem of attribute
        hiding attacks (when an attacker gains access control privilege by hiding some attributes). We have recently
        developed a formal framework for the efficient evaluation of ABAC policies, with the collaboration of Tim
        Willemse. This framework uses Binary Decision Diagrams to make tractable the problem of evaluation policies with
        missing information.
